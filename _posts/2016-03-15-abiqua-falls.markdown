There is no shortage of waterfalls in Oregon, but the more spectacular or prettier ones are too crowded (Multnomah Falls, for example). If you want to see stunning waterfalls in the wild with the whole place for yourself, you have to do what it takes to get to those places.

One of them is Abiqua Falls, near the very popular Silver Falls State Park. Unlike the park, this waterfall is not protected or maintained at all, so you have to be ready to drive on really rough roads (or walk for a long distance, it’s your choice) and hike in less than ideal situations. The trail is primitive but someone has left some ropes there that definitely help to get to the Abiqua Creek. From there though, you are on your own. You’ll need to climb some logs and rocks, and you will get wet. But all this is worth it, and if you don’t believe me…
