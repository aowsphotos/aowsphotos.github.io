This last weekend I had the chance to check out [Saddle Mountain](https://goo.gl/maps/DHcNc7Jh4eB2). To be honest I found out about it just a few weeks ago, and once I got to the top I couldn’t believe I’d been missing out for so long!

The hike is pretty demanding though, it’s almost **3 miles to the top** and it gets steeper and steeper the farther you get (I believe **elevation gain is over 1,600 feet**. The summit is **3,800-foot** high). It was definitely the steepest hike I’ve ever done, but it was short and completely worth it.

I’m not sure how often you can see that “sea of clouds” up there, but it made for what I think is the best sunset I’ve ever witnessed.

If you are planning to go there to watch the sunset from the top, make sure you bring some blankets (it’s pretty cold up there) and a flashlight or headlamp to go down afterwards. At least half of the trail goes through the woods and it gets pretty dark even before the sun sets behind the horizon.

You can see some parts of this hike on my [Travel Vlog](http://youtube.com/c/aowsphotos):
