[Latourell Falls](https://goo.gl/maps/ocNAnL4rTLU2), Columbia Gorge, Oregon

This is the closest waterfall to Portland and no hike is required. During the summer this waterfall barely has any water but these days, after all this rain, it’s pretty powerful and you can’t get close to it without feeling like taking a shower.
