This last weekend I decided to go on a solo-trip to the Washington Coast. It’d been a long time goal of mine and I finally did it. It was a long drive and the trip went wrong in a couple of times, but it was all worth it.

But as beautiful as the coast was, the inland Olympic Peninsula looked just insane and I only got a brief taste of it. I’ll be back soon for sure.

For now, check out the photos and the two vlog episodes of the trip. Hope you enjoy them!
