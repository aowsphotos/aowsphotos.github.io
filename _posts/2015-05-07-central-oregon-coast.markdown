After visiting the Southern and Northern Oregon Coast, we were only missing a short road trip between Florence and Newport. While I still think the south is the best part of the Oregon Coast by far, right in the middle you can find beauties like Yachats, Cape Perpetua or the Heceta Head Lighthouse.

It’s not a short trip to Yachats from Portland, almost 5 hours non-stop. We stayed at a beautiful house near Cape Perpetua for just two nights and moved from there. Let’s begin!

## Heceta Head Lighthouse (part I, daylight)

Our first stop, almost right in our backyard, Heceta Head Lighthouse. By far the most photographed lighthouse in Oregon. It was build in 1892, construction that took more than one year (the bricks were brought from San Francisco).

It doesn’t look like you can get in, but there is a house that works as a bed and breakfast really close to the lighthouse.

As you can see in the photos, humans are not the main users of the beaches nearby. There are hundreds of sea lions “singing” and enjoying the place.

I might be confusing places, but I’d swear we saw (granted, really far) a few whales hanging out there.

## Oregon Dunes & Florence

Florence is the biggest town in the area, but its population is under nine thousand. Actually, the biggest city in the whole coast, unless I’m terribly mistaken, is Newport with barely over 10,000 people. This is one of the reasons why this is a mighty coast and I love it so much. Almost empty miles-long beaches and none of those huge (and ugly) cities you find in California.

The downside though… is that it’s really hard to find all those conveniences we are used to. Among them, an ATM to get cash and pay the entrance to the state parks. We had to drive miles to find one, and then come back to check out the Oregon Dunes.

The Oregon Dunes were formed during millions of years of erosion, and they are the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America. You only need to avoid those few places where people drive boogies — really noisy and annoying.

## Cape Perpetua

Waves hitting rocks. It doesn’t sound exciting, does it? Despite having lived for more than 10 years next to the sea, it still amazes me every single time. This place is no different, and somehow, for some reason I can’t really explain, it makes the sea look 100 times more powerful than in other places.

I don’t really know if the tide was high or low, but at that time we had a generous extension of rocks to walk on and see from a few feet away the angry waves hit the shore over and over.

But what makes this place really special is that little hole in the rocks called **Thor’s Well** (see animation below).

## Heceta Head Lighthouse (and II, night)

Before calling it a day, we headed to the lighthouse again to watch the sunset. It was cloudy so it was not a good one, but we still could get some good views from this scenery place.
